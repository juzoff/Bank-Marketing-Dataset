**Project Description:**

*   **Data Collection:** I started by obtaining the Bank Marketing dataset, which includes various customer attributes and whether they subscribed to a term deposit.

**Data Preparation:**

*   **Data Cleaning:** I cleaned the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. I also encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features to ensure the data was ready for analysis.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conducted EDA to understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and key patterns. This included visualizing the data by plotting various charts in an Excel spreadsheet for better insights. Additionally, I plotted the correlation among attributes to evaluate weak, moderate, and strong correlational relationships.
*   **Class Distribution Analysis:** I assessed whether the dataset had an imbalanced class distribution by examining the proportion of records for different classes. It was determined that the dataset required balancing, which was addressed as part of the data preparation process.

**Documentation and Reporting:**

*   **Documentation and Reporting:** I documented the entire process, including code, methodology, and results, to ensure the project could be easily understood and replicated by others.
