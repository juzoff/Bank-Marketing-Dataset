**Note: This project is organized into multiple branches on GitHub, each correlating with a different portion of the assignment. To explore specific sections, please select the branch that corresponds to the task or analysis you are interested in. This structure allows for a focused review of each component of the project, making it easier to follow along with the data preparation, modeling, and evaluation processes.

**Predictive Modeling/Classification:**

*   **Feature Selection:** To improve model efficiency, I selected relevant features based on their correlation with the target variable (`y`). This involved using statistical tests, feature importance metrics, and logical reasoning to determine which attributes were most likely to influence the target outcome. I carefully developed a selection strategy that balanced statistical evidence with domain knowledge.
*   **Model Building:** I built predictive models using Decision Tree and Naive Bayes algorithms. The Decision Tree model was chosen for its interpretability, while Naive Bayes was selected for its simplicity and efficiency in handling categorical data.
*   **Training and Test Sets:** I created training and test sets for both models using all attributes and the selected attributes. This allowed for a direct comparison of the models' performance on both the original and filtered datasets.
*   **Model Evaluation:** I evaluated the models on training and test sets using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I compared the results between the models trained on all attributes versus those trained on selected attributes to determine which approach led to better predictive performance.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** To optimize the models, I adjusted hyperparameters, such as tree depth for the Decision Tree and smoothing parameters for Naive Bayes, to achieve the best possible performance.
*   **Model Interpretation:** I analyzed the final models to interpret the importance of different features. For example, understanding which customer attributes (e.g., age, job, previous outcomes) had the most significant impact on subscription decisions.
